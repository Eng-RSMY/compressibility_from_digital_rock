# Compressibility_from_Digital_Rock
Compressibility predictions using digital rock simulations

This repository contains the code to obtain the minimum compressibility (Compressibility@1500psi) and maximum compressibility of compressibility curve using Digital Rock Simulations. 

User_guide.docx contains the necessary guidelines for using the code

elas3d.exe in Dependencies folder is the compiled version of NIST code for elastic simulations. The original code can be found in  https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/finite-elementfinite-difference-programs
